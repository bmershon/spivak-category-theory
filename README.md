# Category Theory

This is a self study course (module) in Category Theory which aims to follow the introduction and presentation of category theory found David Spivak's [Category Theory for the Sciences](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/category-theory-sciences). In particular, the course is aimed at introducing enough mechanics from abstract algebra and other disciplines so that one can enjoy a relatively self-contained forray into category theory. Spivak's text seemed to do this better than most, and it is for this reason that it was chosen as the backbone of this module.

Materials collected for self-study of category theory are available to those who have been [given access](https://github.com/bmershon/category-theory/tree/master/reading). Full PDFs of current textbooks cannot be widely distributed for free, as a result of Â© laws.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/bmershon/spivak-category-theory/wiki) for reading guides, notes, and other information related to self study of category theory.
